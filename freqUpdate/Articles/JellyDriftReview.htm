    <img src="ArticleGraphics/DriftReview1.png" height="130px" width="220px" style="float: right; padding: 10px;" alt="Click to enlarge.">Jelly Drift, an indie game made by Dani,  is a game about drifting and racing cars around a bendy map. You can unlock new maps and cars as you play, if you can master the turning system that is. <br><br>

    Before he made Jelly Drift, I had been following Dani's YouTube Channel, entertained by his videos where he made games. Jelly Drift's controls are pretty hard to use, but that was said to be intentional and if you can't master them, then you suck. (a paraphrase of what Dani said in his video where he made Jelly Drift) <br><br>
    
    The menus are really consistent, and intuitive to navigate and use with just arrow keys or WASD, in case you want to take a break from gripping the mouse or rubbing the touchpad on your computer. When you toggle a menu movement, there's also a really satisfying click sound effect, which I think is a nice addition. <br><br>

    <img src="ArticleGraphics/DriftReview2.png" height="130px" width="220px" style="float: left; padding: 10px;" alt="Click to enlarge.">Gameplay is as follows: You can start a race. Each race you win, the more tracks and cars you have access to use. If you want to practice a bit, then just choose the time trial option when starting a game session.<br><br>
    
    The Graphics aren't triple A, but they do their job of conveying enough information at high speeds, and don't look horrible while parked after a not so rare crash. Most things are solid colors instead of being textures, and the models are simple, so it's not too intensive in terms of computing power required either. The music? That's really good though, it has an Initial D style vibe to it, and it's a really catchy tune. However, it can be distracting if the volume is too loud, at least in my opinion. <br><br>
    
	I give this game an 8 out of 10: Adequate graphics, hard controls, cool music, good UI design. <br><br>
