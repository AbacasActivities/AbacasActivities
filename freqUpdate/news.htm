    <h1>Abacas News</h1>
	
    <h2>Update 4 - December 26th, 2022</h2>
    <p style="text-indent:30px;">

        I decided the website didn't look skeuomorphic enough, so I spent some time making different graphics for the background and border. The site is a little less viewable on older browsers, but usability isn't really good on them anyways for seeing what I did have.<br><br>

        <a href="log.htm" target="_blank"><img src="BBAndW/4.png" style="width: 70%; margin-left:88px;"></img></a>

    </p>
