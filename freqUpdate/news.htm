    <h2>Update 2 - December 4th, 2022</h2>
    <p style="text-indent:30px;">

        Abacas Online Aurora is up and viewable via the main domain! From now on, Abacas Online 1.0 will be a historic site, you can find it in the links section on the About page. The site isn't quite finished, though I decided "screw SVG graphics" as waiting to see if I could even make them was killing my motivation to finish this project. Thank you for visiting!<br><br>
