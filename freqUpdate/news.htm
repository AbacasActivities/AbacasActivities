        Welcome to the new Abacas Online Aero! Yes, I redesigned my website again. I finally know all the things I need to know to build a full-page website that looks like this! Anyways, for the time being, I have links to the old pages in the showcase areas because what I've done required re-building the whole website effectively from scratch again, and it took me 3 or so days to get where I've gotten. I'm really proud of the assets, obviously inspired by Windows Vista's design language.<br><br>
