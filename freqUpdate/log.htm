    <h2>Update 5 - January 13th, 2023</h2>
    <p style="text-indent:30px;">

        So, I decided to add a highlights bar to the left of my website as it would be useful feature to any user of the site. I also added a favicon, so the bookmark for any page should be easier to recognize. First update of the new year!<br><br>

        <a href="log.htm" target="_blank"><img src="BBAndW/5.jpg" style="width: 70%; margin-left:88px;"></img></a>

    <h2>Update 4 - December 26th, 2022</h2>
    <p style="text-indent:30px;">

        I decided the website didn't look skeuomorphic enough, so I spent some time making different graphics for the background and border. The site is a little less viewable on older browsers, but usability isn't really good on them anyways for seeing what I did have.<br><br>

    <h2>Update 3 - December 15th, 2022</h2>
    <p style="text-indent:30px;">

        More of my content is now viewable! I built a more comprehensive picture gallery with my new iframe knowledge, and I added placeholder icons to let you know which pages are working. So far, I have completed the videos page, the pictures page, and the articles page. I was able to adapt the old articles to the new page format I made.<br><br>

    <h2>Update 2 - December 4th, 2022</h2>
    <p style="text-indent:30px;">

        Abacas Online Aurora is up and viewable via the main domain! From now on, Abacas Online 1.0 will be a historic site, you can find it in the links section on the About page. The site isn't quite finished, though I decided "screw SVG graphics" as waiting to see if I could even make them was killing my motivation to finish this project. Thank you for visiting!<br><br>

    <h2>Update 1 - November 14th, 2022</h2>
    
    <p style="text-indent:30px;">

        Abacas Online is soon going to change a bit! As of today, I have built the main visual style for Abacas Online: Aurora, a design more akin to aero-glass or aqua, and the final steps I can do on my chromebook will be making all of the links work and fill out each page. Overall the actual completion of Aurora should be sooner than it will be, only because I can't make svg graphics for the GUI.<br><br>
