						Hi! I'm Maura. My online alias is Abacas. I'm an amatuer manga artist who's got a pretty ambitious project. I'm working on a manga called Medium Override. It follows Daisy Higgons through her transition, and many wacky adventures which bend time and space in ways it wasn't intended to. I'm also working on other things, such as this website, (this is the 6th time I've completely rewritten it) and music.
					</p>
					<p>
						Things I like to do include hanging out in voice chats, playing old minecraft, reverting my view of the web to the years between 2000-2013, and last but certainly not least, drawing! I love to dabble in many art mediums, most of which at least start out with 2D work, but I do dip my toes into making a 3D cardboard structure every now and then.
					</p>
					<p>
						If you would like to see my art, you can either view a curated gallery on this website, or follow links to my more up-to-date page on social media. I can do commissions, but if you want to be satisfied with the result, I highly recommend you look at my other art. If I am to do a commission, I reserve the right to display the art work in a portfolio setting, and a rule for the actual art itself is that it cannot be NSFW. I can refuse to draw anything for any reason. Payment will be estimated based on the complexity of the request, and can only be through paypal or cashapp. If a commission from me still sounds good to you, then feel free to email me, the mailto link has moved to the socials page!
					</p>
					<p>
						Lastly, thank you for looking at my site. I really appreciate you reading this, as it means the web is healing.
					</p>

						This update consists of a major rebuild of most of the site, giving it a more retro feel and refreshing the documents.
