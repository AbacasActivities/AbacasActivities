<h2>About Abacas Online/Abacas</h2>
<h3>Why:</h3>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The reason I am developing this 
website instead of doing what most people do (signing up for an off-the-shelf 
social media platform: facebook, twitter, etc.) is because I just don't see the 
point in setting up all those profiles when I can't fully express myself. There 
are other reasons I don't, like I don't trust those corperations nor do I enjoy 
staring at their User Interface design choices.</p>
<h3>Who:</h3>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Who am I? My real first name is Maura, 
but online I will go on as Abacas. No, I can't use one. I'm an overall creative 
person, who wants to express themselves to the highest of my ability, which in 
this case has fueled the creation of this website.</p>
<h3>What:</h3>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This website has the purpose of being a 
collection of my artistic works, and a home for myself on the web. I think it 
would be most accurate to call it a box of my digital stuff, or shortcuts to it 
at least.</p>
