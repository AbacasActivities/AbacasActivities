Chapter 0 – [Davey experiences AQUA:]
</p>
<p>
“What are you doing in the gardening club?” Lucy asks. “Who, me?” asks Davey in return. “Yes, you, you're a boy, why are you taking care of flowers? Shouldn't a girl be doing that?” Asks Lucy. Davey looks down, top half of face blacked out with a frown shown on their face. “Hey, back off,” One of the other club members says. “Other stuff you call him out on make sense, but this is just plain bullying.” The use of the word “boy” and “him” stab Davey in the chest visually, making them wince. “I've gotta go.” says Davey, standing up, taking off their gardening gloves. They throw them on the ground, and storm off away from the fence Lucy was peering through.
</p>
<p>
Davey types up a note on the BacInTime and prints it out, folding it and setting it on the desk. They leave the house and  walk to the bridge nearby their house. They stand on the bridge.  They take a deep breath, trembling. “This is such STUPID idea,” Davey yells. They look to the side of the bridge, something catching their eye. “Actually- What the fuck is that?,” they think, before walking over to a weird looking blue computer sitting in a pile of boxes. 
</p>
<p>
Davey picks up the note, throwing it out, and sets down the keyboard to the computer they found on the bridge. Jessie perks her head up and stares at the monitor, barely interested. "What are we doing again?" she asks. "We're seeing what's on this random computer I found" Davey says. They confidently hit the power button and both start waiting in suspense. A chime is shortly heard, and Davey becomes excited. Jessie just rolls her eyes. "Ugh, it would have been more interesting if it exploded," she says. The CRT monitor of the iBac flickers on for a second, then dies. Not a sound is coming from the machine anymore. "Ha, knew it wouldn't work," Jessie says. "Good too, who knows what was on there." Davey sits there, glaring at Jessie with an annoyed expression. “No, it'll work, Sometimes electronics need to be charged with the first power on... I think” Davey successfully boots the computer, annoying Jessie. “Hm, this looks like an application, this icon on the desktop. I'm gonna open it.” Davey navigates the mouse cursor to the icon, and double clicks. The cursor changes to the loading animation, then changes back to normal. "Wait- do you hear that?" Jessie asks. Rushing water noises coming from the iBac kept getting louder and louder. Suddenly, a Jet of water quickly formed, impossibly spraying out of the closed glass of the CRT display, knocking Jessie to the floor. The high pressure stream of water then re-positions, spraying Davey, but the water behaves weirdly when it hits them. It encircled them, 'til none of Davey's body was exposed to air. Unable to breath, Davey passes out.

"Davey!" Davey slowly opens their eyes. "DAVEY!" Now fully alert, Davey realizes that Jessie is kneeling beside them, and that her face is very close to theirs. In a moment, Davey rolls over and coughs out a bunch of water, which dissipates on contact with the floor. "Oh my god, I thought you were a goner!" Jessie yells. "Yeah- what the heck happened-" Davey replies. Davey hears the familiar noise of keys unlocking the door. Davey panics. "Oh. my. God." says Jessie. "What?" Davey asks. "YOUR HAIR!?" Davey glances over at a mirror. "WHAT THE FUCK???" Davey shrieks. "Oh god, oh god, what do I do?" Davey asks, panicking. "Uhm... I have an idea. Get naked and put a towel on!" Jessie orders.

"Did you guys dye Davey's hair?" Asks Davey's mother, Margaret. In an instant, Davey's hair returns to the normal color, the iBac's startup chime is heard from upstairs. "Wh- ...I'm gonna go TO BED. I'm apparently hallucinating, my bad. " Margaret storms off to her bedroom and flops on the bed. "It's getting late, actually, so I'm gonna go home," Jessie says. "Message me if more weird stuff goes on!" After the door slams shut, Davey stands there for a second. They struggle to

shrug it off, and walk back to their room.
