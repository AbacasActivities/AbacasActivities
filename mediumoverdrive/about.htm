    <h2>To sum up the current introduction:</h2>
	
    <p style="padding:50px;text-indent:60px">
    Davey is all dysphoric in the first part of the introduction, and then it's a flashback from them sitting in school. They suddenly need to take a piss, and 'accidently' take the girl's pass. With their egg ass logic and urgent need to go, they just use the girl's restroom. Davey's sitting there all euphoric, when along comes Buttercup, who was sent with the boy's pass to retrieve the girls pass. Davey hears Buttercup assume Davey is in the boy's bathroom, which is wrong. Davey tries to sneak out, but Buttercup catches them on the way out and calls them a perv. She snatches the pass and throws the boys one at Davey, and Davey starts to cry. They skip the rest of school for fear of being seen after any sort of gossip had spread. <br><br>
	Once home Davey locks themself in their room, and starts crying again. They scream and yell into a pillow, then look up laying there. Eventually, Davey hears  their phone ringing. It turns out to be Janet, a tinkerer that's friends with their mother and had become something of a mentor figure for Davey. Davey talks to Janet, whose words are slurred as if massively tired, and agrees to try out something Janet has been working on. Davey recovers, wishing the day had gone better, and decides to go try it out.<br><br>
