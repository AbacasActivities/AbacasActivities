	Medium Overdrive is a story about Daisy Higgons, and their unusual route of transition. With the help of a piece of technology that her mom's friend developed, she can take the form of a supernatural being- that happens to expose the "resonent self image" of the user. <br><br>This form gives her special abilities, themed to her energy, which is signed as precision. One thing she can do is direct very accurate and precise beams of energy at things, blasting holes in them. Eventually, two others by the names of Ember and Buttercup join on, each with signatures of Drive and Force respectively.<br><br>These peices of technology are little wristbands
