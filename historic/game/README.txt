I know this is cringe writing a readme for such a simple file, but bear with me-

to run this you need to extract the main folder and open the html file, called "index," 
in a browser with javascript capabilities. (chrome, firefox, palemoon, etc.)

hopefully that covers it, and anyone able to read, and identify the software they use,
can use my simple "mad lib".
