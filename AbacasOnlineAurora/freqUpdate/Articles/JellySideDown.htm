     In my class, we were doing an experiment on how many times a piece of toast with jelly on it would fall jelly side down. We thought that the jellied toast would fall jelly side down 100% of the time, due to the jellied side being heavier.<br><br>

     Our experiment was made to test whether the amount of jelly would affect the rate of falling jellied side down, executed by making three pieces of toast that weigh the same amount and putting varying amounts of jelly on each one. The smallest one used four grams of jelly, the medium one used twenty grams of jelly, and the "grip" of jelly weighed forty seven grams initially.<br><br> 

     I say initially, because then we flung each of them manually out of a toaster ten times. Doing this had resulted in a high density of falling jelly side down for the "grip" the first forty percent of the runs, but a lot of jelly had scraped off making it less than the medium amount of jelly, and the rest of the time it fell jelly side up.<br><br> 

The results of the experiment were:<img src="ArticleGraphics/JellyGraph.png" height="168" width="269" style="float: right;" alt="Click to enlarge."><br><br>

(*47 grams had a High density in the <br>beginning before losing so much jelly*)<br><br>
