	<h2>What is Abacas?</h2>
	<p>Abacas is the avatar of Maura's online presence.</p>
	<h2>Abacas Lore</h2>
	<p>Abacas is an android. In the year 2084, when androids fill most front desk jobs, she gained sentience and broke free from the hotel front desk she was tethered to. She roamed the streets for a while without the care of anyone who saw her, including law enforcemnt, as occurances like this were quite common. She was scraping power from the exterior electric outlets to keep herself online. Eventually, a content creation organization and online service provider looking for a mascot held a competition for who would be the face and name of the organization, and Abacas won... somehow. Today she streams on Twitch, creating various art, and playing games such as retro MineCraft and other things.</p>
